User Guide

Master gradient-free optimization with GFO. This guide covers core concepts,
algorithm selection, and advanced features for efficient black-box optimization.

.. tip::

   New to GFO? Start with :ref:`search_spaces` to understand how to define
   parameter spaces, then explore :ref:`optimizers` to choose your algorithm.

How GFO Works
=============

Gradient-Free-Optimizers provides a simple pattern: define your search space,
choose an optimizer, and run. All algorithms share the same interface, making
it easy to experiment with different approaches.

.. code-block:: python

    # The GFO optimization pattern
    from gradient_free_optimizers import BayesianOptimizer
    import numpy as np

    # 1. Define where to search
    search_space = {
        "x": np.linspace(-10, 10, 100),
        "y": np.linspace(-10, 10, 100),
    }

    # 2. Choose how to optimize
    opt = BayesianOptimizer(search_space)

    # 3. Run optimization
    opt.search(objective_function, n_iter=100)

    # 4. Get results
    print(opt.best_para)   # Best parameters
    print(opt.best_score)  # Best score achieved
